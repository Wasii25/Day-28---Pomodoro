    Just like the normal pomodoro:
    <ol>
      <li>
        There is a timer for 25 mins which is the work session (which is customizable based on the users needs)
      </li>
      <li>
        After the work session is the break for 5 mins (which again, is customizable to suit the user)
      </li>
  </li>
</ul>
